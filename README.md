# Overview

The Software that I have wrote is a BlackJack game where the player will try to get as close as possible to 21 without going over that number. As a Software Engineer, I created
this game to enhance my programming skills in python in creating an interactive application.

The purpose for writing this software is so that I could could practice implementing game logic and user interaction in a Python-based application. Additionally, it was a fun way
to reinforce basic programming principles such as loops, conditionals, list comprehension, etc.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

The tools that I have used to develop this software was VS code, Python interpreter, and the command line. 

The language used in this project was Python, and I used the random and sys libraries to manage the cards being delt and the program exit.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- One thing that I'm going to implement in the near future is given the dealer's top card, and the player's current hand, the user will have the opportunity to view their 
chances of winning.
- Another thing that I will add in the future is that when a user is dealt an Ace, they will be able to choose if they would like it to count for "1" or "11."
- Lastly, I would like to add a GUI where the game isn't played in the terminal, but you can possibly actually see the cards be dealt for you, and the options to hit, stand, 
play again, or quit will be buttons.
